        1 Both are monitoring tools for your AWS resources.<br><br>
        2 Both track changes and store a history of what happened to your resources in the past<br><br>
        3 Both used for similar purposesâ€”compliance and governance, auditing, security policies etc<br><br>
        4 In short, if something goes wrong with your AWS resources, you'll likely notice it in both Config and CloudTrail.

      <td>Difference</td>
      <td>
        1 Although they report the same incidents often, they have a different perspective and approach.<br><br>
        2 Config reports on what has changed, whereas CloudTrail reports on who made the change, when, and from which location.<br><br>
        3 Config is focused on the configuration of your AWS resources and reports with detailed snapshots on how your resources have changed. CloudTrail focuses on the events, or API calls, that drive those changes. CloudTrail focuses on the user, application, and activity performed on the system.
