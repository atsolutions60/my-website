            <tr><td>It stays in sync with the primary database, constantly updating itself with any new data.</td></tr>
            <tr><td>But unlike the primary, a read replica is read-only, meaning it can only handle data reads, not changes like updates or deletions.</td></tr>

    <h2>Why Use a Read Replica?</h2>

            <tr><th>Benefits</th></tr>
            <tr><td>When your application has many users, the primary database can become slow due to too many requests.</td></tr>
            <tr><td>To solve this, read replicas are used to reduce the load on the primary database by handling all the "read" requests.</td></tr>
            <tr><td>This way, the primary database can focus on handling "write" requests, making the whole system faster and more efficient.</td></tr>

                <td>The read replica automatically receives data updates from the primary database. This means any changes made to the primary database are reflected in the read replica.</td>

            <tr>
                <td>Read Traffic Distribution</td>
                <td>You can direct read requests from your application to the read replica instead of the primary database. This reduces load on the primary database.</td>

                    Read replicas cannot automatically take over as the primary database if the primary fails.<br><br>
                    Unlike Multi-AZ setups, which provide automatic failover, a read replica must be manually promoted to become the new primary if needed.<br><br>
                    This means that read replicas are not a substitute for Multi-AZ configurations when high availability and automatic failover are required.

                    Useful for distributing read traffic locally and improving performance.<br><br>
                    Choosing different AZs for your read replicas can improve fault tolerance.
